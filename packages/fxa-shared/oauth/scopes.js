/**
 * A `ScopeSet` object represents a set of validated scope string values,
 * against which we can perform various membership checks and set-like
 * operations such as:
 *
 *  - Checking whether one set of scope values wholly or partly
 *    contains another set.
 *
 *  - Filtering out scope values that are (or are not) implied
 *    by another set.
 *
 *  - Aggregating values into a single set.
 *
 * A quick note on some terminology:
 *
 *  - A "scope" is a string value representing a particular capabilty
 *    that can be granted to client applications.  Such strings can be
 *    in one of two forms:
 *
 *     - a "short-name scope" such as "profile" or "profile:email"
 *     - a "URL-format scope" such as "https://identity.mozilla.com/apps/sync"
 *
 *  - We say that a scope "implies" another scope if it represents
 *    a strictly more general capability.  For example:
 *
 *     - the scope "profile" implies "profile:email" and "profile:avatar",
 *       but does not imply "basket" or "profile:write".
 *
 *     - the scope "profile:write" implies "profile" and "profile:email:write",
 *       but does not imply "basket" or "basket:write".
 *
 *     - the scope "https://identity.mozilla.com/apps/sync" implies
 *       "https://identity.mozilla.com/apps/sync/bookmarks", but does not
 *       imply "https://identity.mozilla.com/apps/lockbox".
 *
 *  - If a scope A implies scope B, then we say that B is a "sub-scope"
 *    of A, and that A is an "implicant" of B.  Any scope value has a
 *    finite number of implicants.
 *
 *  - We group individual scope values into sets represented by the
 *    `ScopeSet` object.
 *
 * We expect that the `ScopeSet` class will be used to process user-provided
 * data, so it's important that it provides efficient operations that do
 * not open potential DoS vectors.  In particular, we need to ensure
 * linear-time-or-better membership testing and merging of multiple `ScopeSet`
 * instances.
 *
 * Performance is achieved by using a simple trick: for any given scope value,
 * we can pre-compute a finite set of all possible implicants.  This allows us
 * to implement "A implies B" as a simple string lookup for "A" in the set of
 * implicants of "B".
 *
 * The tradeoff here is memory usage, as we have to store the full
 * set of implicants for each scope value in the set.  We expect that this
 * will not be too problematic in practice, because the size of this set is
 * linear in the length of the scope value. A more memory-friendly approach
 * could use a trie-like data structure to efficiently store all implicants
 * with prefix compression, at the cost of significant code complexity.
 *
